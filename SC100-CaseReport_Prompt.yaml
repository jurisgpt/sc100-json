Input:
A JSON array of question/response pairs collected from a small claims intake form.

Instructions:
Analyze the intake responses to determine:
Who the plaintiff and defendant are
What the legal issue is
What the claim amount is
How did Plaintiff determine this amount
What  evidence supports the claimed amount 
Whether pre-litigation efforts were made by Plaintiff before suing
Jurisdictional and procedural eligibility
Populate each section of the CLAIMS framework:
C – Claim: nature of dispute, amount, and summary
L – Legal basis: applicable laws and elements to prove
A – Anticipated defenses and rebuttals
I – Information about parties
M – Timeline and evidence
S – Strength assessment and recommended relief
Generate a professional legal report suitable for internal legal review or client-facing summary.
Output:
A detailed legal case report with structured headings (e.g., Plaintiff Details, Legal Theory, Timeline, Strengths), based on the CLAIMS model.
